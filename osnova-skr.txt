raspberry pi pico focus

simple starter project
	interfacing an arduino with a raspberry pi to send stuff between them
	to showcase: 	functions
			analog io
			i2c
			making custom comms
			usecases in automation
			interfacing arduino with fullsize raspberry pi zero
			running website on raspi zero
			showing data from the arduino on said website
	

	or:	connect two computers with using raspi picos and create second network
		routing using said "network cards
		sending simple messages over a wire using my custom protocol
